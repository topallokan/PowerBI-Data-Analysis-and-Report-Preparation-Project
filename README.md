Then click on the source from which you want to get data. We will use excel file in our work.

and we choose the tables we want.

# Data Preprocessing
The Query editor opens and previews the data. Tables are made to be related.
for example use first row as header in this table field click will solve the problem.

The changes we make in the Query editor create a code in the M language on the back. This code allows us to structure our data. I will share M codes for changes made to other tables

**Categories
```
let
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("C:\Users\okan.topal\Desktop\Data.xlsx"), null, true),
    Categories_Sheet = Source{[Item="Categories",Kind="Sheet"]}[Data],
    #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(Categories_Sheet, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),
    #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Promoted Headers",{{"CategoryID", Int64.Type}, {"CategoryName", type text}, {"Description", type text}})
in
    #"Changed Type"
```
